# Theme test

Cloned and played with the repo in order to have some fun with premade themes and test its ease of use, turns out its exactly what it says on the tin! (or rather in the README)...

Having built a __Jekyll__ blog from scratch in order to familiarise myself with the setup already, I have decided to use a premade theme to make things simpler.

If its not broke, I won't fix it, but I will try to make it better....

here is a quick intro to what attracted me to this theme and its creator:



## Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependancies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog like the one below giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!
